# Convert-Simple-Tab-Groups
Convert a backup of Simple Tab Groups into a Tab Stash compatible file

1. Download the main.py file
2. Put a Simple Tab Groups backup in the same folder as the main.py file
3. Replace `<your backup file>` with name of the backup file
4. Run the script
5. A text file will be created in the same folder
5. Copy the content of the text file into the import option in Tab Stash
  
I tested this with both addons in Firefox.
